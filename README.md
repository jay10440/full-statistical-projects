This repository contains full statistical projects where I apply end-to-end data analysis workflows. Each project typically includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and interpretation of results.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Complete statistical analyses with real-world or simulated datasets.
- Jupyter notebooks and/or scripts documenting the project steps.
- Visualizations and reports to support findings.
- A variety of statistical techniques like regression, classification, and hypothesis testing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo: https://github.com/jay10440/full-statistical-projects.git
2.  Open the project folder or notebook you want to explore.
3. Run the code interactively or read through the documented workflow.

## Notes

- These projects showcase my practical experience and evolving skills.
- Some projects are more polished than others; all are learning opportunities.
- Feedback and collaboration ideas are always welcome!
